## Introduction
This project is a web based project. The main purpose of this project is to learn how to type 9 fingers on the keyboard, besides developing the project. One of the most important steps I took as a software developer was learning to write without looking at the keyboard. This both provided me comfort and increased my productivity to a certain extent. I wish patience to everyone who wants to learn how to write with 9 fingers and hope they will be success.
